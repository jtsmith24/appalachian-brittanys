            Limited spots are available, and selections are made based on the
            order in which deposits are received. Puppies will receive their
            first round of Distemper and Parvovirus vaccinations at 6 weeks old,
            included in the purchase price. Additionally, they will be treated
            for worms at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. The second round of
            Distemper vaccinations at 8 weeks old will be the buyer's
            responsibility, typically costing around $30.00. Puppies will also
            have their dewclaws removed and tails docked. They will be ready to
            join their new homes at 8 weeks of age.
