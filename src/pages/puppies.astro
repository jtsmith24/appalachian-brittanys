            Limited spots available. Picks are made in order the deposits are
            received. Pups will have their first round of Distemper, parvovirus
            shots at 6 weeks old that is included in the purchase price and
            treated for worms at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of age. Second round of
            vaccines for distemper at 8 weeks old will be at the buyers expense
            (usually around $30.00). Puppies will have their Dewclaws removed
            and tails docked. They will be ready to go to their new homes when
            they are 8 weeks of age.
